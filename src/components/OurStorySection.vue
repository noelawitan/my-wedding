          <p class="text-center">
            In a year that challenged the world, our paths miraculously crossed. We soon became friends, sharing endless
            conversations and laughter. As the seasons changed, so did our friendship, blossoming into something deeper
            and more meaningful.
            When the world started to reopen, we began going on magical dates, each one more enchanting than the last.
            Our hearts soon knew that we were made for each other.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center">
            We introduced each other to our families and friends, confirming what we already knew: we were home. We've
            explored new places, tasted new flavors, and built an endless list of memories.
            Noel found creative ways for us to spend quality time together, from surprise getaways to cozy game nights,
            making even the simplest moments unforgettable.
